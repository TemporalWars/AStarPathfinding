<p>I started the FREE game engine in 2008, as a silly side-project to learn the XNA framework. However, the longer I worked on the project, the more I wanted to accomplish.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the A* pathfinding portion of the project become a HUGE piece
 of the R.T.S. game.&nbsp; I used many sources of information, from online how-to articles and technical books, to piece together the best of A* pathfinding algorithm for the PC and XBOX-360.</p>
<p>Now 2012, I have decided to upload my sample WPF application, which shows how to use the A* Pathfinding dll in one of your own projects!&nbsp; Be it a PC project, Xbox XNA project or a Windows Phone project, you can now use this assembly, as shown in my
 sample.&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Description</strong><br>
<br>
This <span style="color:#ff0000">A* XNA</span> Component is designed from the ground up, to take full advantage of the XBox's and PC threading capabilities. The A* component contains an A* Manager, with three A* path finding engines, allowing for 3 simultaneous
 path searches, while also maintaining excellent performance and low G.C.(Garbage Collection).<br>
<br>
Performance is achieved and maintained, due to key concepts incorporated into the A* component, like the 'Cheap List'<a href="/wikipage?title=3&referringTitle=Home">3</a> methology. Also the 'Closed List'<a href="/wikipage?title=4&referringTitle=Home">4</a>
 is eliminated all together, since an array with Enum types are used to quickly update the status of A* nodes inside the core A* algorithm.<br>
<br>
The <span style="color:#ff0000">A* XNA</span> component also contains the A<strong>-</strong>Graph, which allows for directly tracking blocked/unblocked nodes; a vital part of the pathfinding formula. Furthermore, the A-Graph accepts point-value setting, to
 influence different parts of the map; for example, higher point-values represent rough terrain, and lower point-values represent passable terrain. The A<strong>-</strong>Graph is automatically used in the core A algorithm, influencing the overall pathfinding
 search results.<br>

<span style="color:#008000"><strong>What you Get!</strong></span><br>
<br>
The download zip file contains the 'AStarComponent.dll' assembly, designed to be usable in any other XNA project for the PC and Xbox-360. You can also use the bindable component in other types of projects, like simple WPF (Windows Presentation Format) projects
 for school demonstrations or for learning the A* algorithm. The 'AStarComponent.dll' assembly is designed for extreme performance, and was tested 1000 of hours on the Xbox-360 and PC.<br>
<br>
The download zip also contains a simple WPF 'AStarSampleApp', shown in the picture above, which shows you how to use the AStar component. With this sample application, you can study the C# code to see how to call and create A* solution paths in seconds. The
 code shows how to start bind the assembly, initialize the iternal A* graph, and make &quot;Find-Path&quot; solution paths in a matter of seconds! Feel free to use the code in any project you desire.<br>
<br>
